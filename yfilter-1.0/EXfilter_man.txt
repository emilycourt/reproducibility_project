NAME
	 edu.berkeley.cs.db.yfilter.filter.EXfilter
	 - Processes queries on a set of documents, and outputs 
	   the query results and the processing performance. 

SYNOPSIS
	 java edu.berkeley.cs.db.yfilter.filter.EXfilter
		(DOC_FILE | DOC_DIR) QUERY_FILE [options]

PARAMETERS

DOC_FILE | DOC_DIR
	 XML document or Directory containing a set of XML documents.

QUERY_FILE
	 File containing the queries. 

OPTIONS

--num_docs=NUM
	 Number of documents to be processed.

--num_queries=NUM
	 Number of queries to be processed.

--profile
	 Enables profiling.
		NOTE: The profiling results are output to "profile.txt" in the current working directory. 

--result=LEVEL
	 Result level. LEVEL can be one of the following: 
		NONE - no output.
		BOOLEAN - if the query is matched (TRUE/FALSE).   
		ONE  - one matching element.
		ALL  - all matching elements.
		     NOTE: The default setting for benchmarking is BOOLEAN. The query results are
		     output to "result.txt" in the current working directory, if the --output option 
		     is not set to "indiv". 

--output=indiv
	 Output query results to individual files.
		NOTE: Once output is set to "indiv", the query results are output to multiple files 
		in the working directory, one per XML document, in order of document execution.

--nfa_opt=LEVEL
	 The NFA execution level. LEVEL can be one of the following:
		2 -- for NFA execution and result collection
		1 -- for NFA execution and simplified result collection
		     if queries don't contain predicates
		0 -- for NFA execution only
		     NOTE: The NFA execution level partially depends on the result level.
		     nfa_opt can be set to 1, only if the result level is NONE, BOOLEAN, or ONE.
		     nfa_opt can be set to 0, only if the result level is NONE.
		     The default setting for benchmarking is: result = BOOLEAN, nfa_opt = 1.

--msg_preparse=FLAG
	 Preparse messages. FLAG can be TRUE or FALSE.

--warmup=VALUE
	 Warm-up the filter. VALUE can be one of the following two cases:
		1) an XML document file used for warming up or, 
		2) a positive integer, indicating the number of documents 
		   to be used for warming up if the input is an XML directory.
